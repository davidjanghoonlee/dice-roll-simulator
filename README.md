# Dice Roll Simulator

##2016-01-10

#### Success
I succeeded creating a dice-roll-simlulator that works.

#### Failure
I failed to create a dice-roll-simulator just the way I wanted. I wanted to use for loop, but I was stuck.

#### Question
1. What do these values return 
  [choice == 'y' or 'Y']
  [ choice == 'n' or 'N']
2. How can I assign (True) and (False) value to literal values?
